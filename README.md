# Job Application Tracker 📝

Have you ever applied to so many different jobs and internships that you lost track of which ones were pending, which ones were declined, and when did you apply to one or another?

If so, you are in the right place, this web application allows you to keep track and organize all your jobs applications in a simple and minimalistic manner. This way, if you ever feel lost or you don't remember if you already applied for a specific company you can always look back at all your previous submissions!
